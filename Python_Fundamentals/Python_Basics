Variables:- Variable names can only contain letters,numbers and underscore spaces aren't allowed

Strings:- (str()) is a series of characters.

Method:- Action that python can perform on peice of data, Every Method is followed by paranthesis

Basic Arithmetic operators:- 
	 Multiplication (*)
	 Division (/)
	 Integer division (//)  {Takes the largest integer that is equal to or smaller than the quotient}
	 Modulus (%)  {Takes the remainder}
	 Addition (+)
	 Substraction (-)
	
	
Some Basic Functions and Methods in python:- 

	(i). Defining Functions:- 
		       	
		      def function_name()
					  statement(s)
					
	(ii). Functions Arguments:-
			(a). Required Arguements:-  
            Arguments passed to a function in correct positional order.
			(b). Keyword Arguements:- 
				    This allows you to skip arguments or place them out of order because python interpreter is able to use he keyword provided to match the values with parameters.
			(c). Default Arguments:- 
				   Arguments that assume a default value if a value is not provided in the function call for that argument.
				
			(d). Variable-length Arguments:-
					Allows python to process a function with more than one Arguement.
					syntax:
					def function_name([formal_arg,] *var_arg_tuple):

					(*) places before varaible name holds the values of all nonkeyword variable.
					
	 (iii). Python Recursion:- 
			    Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself.
			
	  (iv). Lambda Funtions:- 			  
					
	\n :- Tells python to perform action on new line
	
	\t :- Creates tabs.
	
	rstrip() :- Tells python to strip whitespace from 					 from right side.
	
	List:- collection of objects in a specific order.
	 		 syntax:  list['object1','object2']
	 		 object assignment in List:
		                  	 0      1       2      3
				list=['obj1','obj2','obj3','obj4']
					-4     -3     -2     -1 
	
			 To access a specific value we use indexing.
